/* Steps for Program Developement
1) Define The problem
2) Outline the solution
3) Develope the outline into an algoritm
4) Test the algorith for correctness
5) Code the algorith into specific programming language
6) Run the program on the computer
7) Document and maintain the program

/*
Basic Computer Operations 

Input data
output data
perform arithmetic
assign value to memory location
compare variables and slect alternate actions
repeat one or a group of actions


/*
Control Structure Theorem

Sequence = Executing one step and another, set of steps

Selection = Executing on Step according to the value of a boolean expression

Repetition = Executing a step until a boolean expression is true

*/

/*
Euclid's Algorith
find the greatest common divisor 


*/

/*
Sequential Operations
One after the other

no Repetition
order in sequence important

all steps executed
